# 👋 Hi, I’m Yesenia Puga!

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from UC Santa Cruz with a passion for embedded systems, neuroscience, and building tech that makes a difference. I enjoy creating hardware-software projects that integrate microcontrollers, sensors, and real-world applications — especially in the medical and biological space.

---

## 🛠️ What I Work On
- **ESP32 Projects** (BLE, sensors, power optimization)
- **SwiftUI App Development** (BLE integration, live data)
- **Python + PyQt Tools** for biological image annotation
- **C Programming** for multithreaded HTTP servers
- **Hardware Prototyping** with sensors, PCBs, and IR/camera systems
